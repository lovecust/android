 *
 * Base components of Android.
 *
 * 1. Set and share rules of `Basic` priorities and methods.
 * 2. `Basic` may be unnecessary in some condition, so in that case, do not use it or create new
 *          Base components to add desired functions.
 * 3. `Base components should be very basic or it will be abandoned immediately.
 * 4. Try it and redraw it someday later :(
 * // 5. Reading others' codes and participate in popular repository is also important as starting a
 *          project and writing codes without stopping.
